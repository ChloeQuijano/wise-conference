                        <p> Workshops are a wonderful way for you to more actively take part in the Conference! Our demos, activities, 
                            and guided discussions are designed to allow you to get exposure to new concepts, develop useful skills, and engage 
                            with fellow attendees. Our workshops this year fall under 7 streams: Consulting, Tech, Engineering, Academia, Professional 
                            Development, Personal Development, and EDI. With the focus being more on skill-building, we believe that everyone will be able 
                            to find something useful and inspiring from attending these workshops, no matter where their interests lie.

                                <p>Hey, I’m Leanne. I work at Shopify as an application security engineer where I mainly work on protecting web applications against security vulnerabilities. 
                                    There are many different areas of web application security and this vast complexity can be overwhelming, especially as a beginner. This workshop will walk 
                                    through some basic domain knowledge and security fundamentals helpful to anyone starting a journey in web application security. We will cover the most common web 
                                    security vulnerabilities as well as what is needed to find and exploit these flaws. Who wouldn't want to feel like Mr. Robot?

                                <p>The formula for career advancement is often seen to be comprised of technical abilities and immense hard work. While this is largely true, self-advocacy also plays a critical part in 
                                    our career growth. This element can easily be overlooked, especially for young professionals. Interestingly, while women are good at advocacy on the behalf of others, many of us 
                                    struggle with self-promotion. This workshop will go over some statistics on females in STEM industries. We will highlight the connection of social norms, gender, and its impact on 
                                    professional advancement. We will discuss methods to advocate for ourselves, promote our skillsets and eventually achieve our career goals. The workshop is hosted by Christine Kwong and Rezwana Sharmin from Qualcomm Inc.
                                    Qualcomm is a leading technology company with a wide range of services from 5G wireless to IoT.

                                    provide inclusivity training, and run social events for our community. Join QueerSphere for a discussion about what role identity plays in the STEM profession. 
                                    Why are gender and sexual orientation relevant in the workplace? How does diversity impact innovation? We’ll be answering these questions and more on topics such 
                                    as intersectionality, gender, and inclusivity. No idea what the letters in 2SLGBTQ+ mean? Don’t sweat it! We’ll help you out with that too!             
                                </p>

                    <p>Kathryn Lueders is the NASA Associate Administrator of the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate. 
                        Kathryn began her NASA career in 1992 at the White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico, where she was the Shuttle Orbital 
                        Maneuvering System and Reaction Control Systems Depot manager. She later moved to the International Space Station Program 
                        and served as transportation integration manager, where she led commercial cargo resupply services to the space station. 
                        Prior to becoming Associate Administrator, Kathryn served as the Program Manager for the Commercial Crew Program for seven 
                        years, where she directed NASA’s efforts to send astronauts to space on private spacecraft, culminating in the successful 
                        launch of Demo-2 from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on May 30, 2020. She holds a Bachelor of Business Administration 
                        in Finance from the University of New Mexico, and a Bachelor of Science and Master of Science in Industrial Engineering from

                    <p>Dahun graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of 
                        Oklahoma. She worked full-time for 2.5 years as a production supervisor in the food 
                        industry before going for a master’s degree in Engineering Management. She chose to pursue a master’s 
                        degree in Engineering Management because she desired to build product development and project management 
                        skills that will enable her to seamlessly transition to project management roles in a highly innovative 
                        and disruptive company. She graduated with a master’s degree in Engineering Management from the Illinois 
                        Institute of Technology in May 2020. Graduating during a global pandemic made the job search more tedious than 
                        she had expected. However, after several months of applying, networking and rejections, she eventually secured a 
                        full-time role as a Technical Project Manager at Tesla.
 
                        During her free time, Dahun enjoys creating and editing videos that entertain and inspire millennials. She’s also 
                        created videos to market small businesses based in the United Kingdom and United States. In 2019, she also launched 
                        a platform called, Beyond Our Limitations, to provide mentorship and financial support to international students in the 
                        United States. This platform was birthed because of the challenges Dahun faced as an international student in the United States. 
                        Her goal is to use this platform to share her story, build a community of international students and remind them that they can achieve 
                        great things in life if they look beyond their limitations!
